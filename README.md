for this project, which you are [welcome to join](https://join.slack.com/t/eventsourcinginpython/shared_invite/enQtMjczNTc2MzcxNDI0LTJjMmJjYTc3ODQ3M2YwOTMwMDJlODJkMjk3ZmE1MGYyZDM4MjIxODZmYmVkZmJkODRhZDg5N2MwZjk1YzU3NmY).


## Features

**Event store** — appends and retrieves domain events. Uses a
sequenced item mapper with a record manager to map domain events
to database records in ways that can be easily extended and replaced.

**Layer base classes** — suggest how to structure an event sourced application.
The library has base classes for application objects, domain entities, entity repositories,
domain events of various types, mapping strategies, snapshotting strategies, cipher strategies,
etc. They are well factored, relatively simple, and can be easily extended for your own
purposes. If you wanted to create a domain model that is entirely stand-alone (recommended by
purists for maximum longevity), you might start by replicating the library classes.

**Notifications and projections** — reliable propagation of application
events with pull-based notifications allows the application state to be
projected accurately into replicas, indexes, view models, and other applications.

**Process and systems** — scalable event processing with application pipelines. Runnable
with single thread, multiprocessing on a single machine, and in a cluster of machines
using the actor model. Parallel pipelines are synchronised with causal dependencies.


### Additional features

**Versioning** - allows model changes to be introduced after an application
has been deployed. Both domain events and domain entity classes can be versioned.
The recorded state of an older version can be upcast to be compatible with a new
version. Stored events and snapshots are upcast from older versions
to new versions before the event or entity object is reconstructed.

**Snapshotting** — avoids replaying an entire event stream to
obtain the state of an entity. A snapshot strategy is included which reuses
the capabilities of this library by implementing snapshots as events.

**Hash chaining** — Sequences of events can be hash-chained, and the entire sequence
of events checked for data integrity. Information lost in transit or on the disk from
database corruption can be detected. If the last hash can be independently validated,
then so can the entire sequence.

**Correlation and causation IDs** - Domain events can easily be given correlation and
causation IDs, which allows a story to be traced through a system of applications.

**Compression** - reduces the size of stored domain events and snapshots, usually
by around 25% to 50% of the original size. Compression reduces the size of data
in the database and decreases transit time across a network.

**Application-level encryption** — encrypts and decrypts stored events and snapshots,
using a cipher strategy passed as an option to the sequenced item mapper. Can be used
to encrypt some events, or all events, or not applied at all (the default). This means
data will be encrypted in transit across a network ("on the wire") and at disk level
including backups ("at rest"), which is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions
when dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) for example the EU's GDPR.

**Optimistic concurrency control** — ensures a distributed or horizontally scaled
application doesn't become inconsistent due to concurrent method execution. Leverages
optimistic concurrency controls in adapted database management systems.

**Worked examples** — simple example application and systems, with an example entity
class, example domain events, and an example database table. Plus lots of examples
in the documentation.


## Synopsis

Define a domain model. Here we define a model with one aggregate root
class called "World", which has a command method called "make_it_so" that
triggers a domain event called "SomethingHappened", which mutates the
aggregate by appending the "what" of the domain event to the "history"
of the world.

```python
from eventsourcing.domain.model.aggregate import AggregateRoot


class World(AggregateRoot):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(World, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.history = []

    def make_it_so(self, something):
        self.__trigger_event__(World.SomethingHappened, what=something)

    class SomethingHappened(AggregateRoot.Event):
        def mutate(self, aggregate):
            aggregate.history.append(self.what)
```

Generate a cipher key (optional).

```python
from eventsourcing.utils.random import encoded_random_bytes

# Keep this safe.
cipher_key = encoded_random_bytes(num_bytes=32)
```

Configure environment variables (optional).

```python
import os

# Cipher key (random bytes encoded with Base64).
os.environ['CIPHER_KEY'] = cipher_key

# SQLAlchemy-style database connection string.
os.environ['DB_URI'] = 'sqlite:///:memory:'
```

Run the code. Construct application and use as context manager.

```python
from eventsourcing.application.notificationlog import NotificationLogReader
from eventsourcing.application.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyApplication
from eventsourcing.exceptions import ConcurrencyError

with SQLAlchemyApplication(persist_event_type=World.Event) as app:

    # Create new aggregate.
    world = World.__create__()

    # Aggregate not yet in repository.
    assert world.id not in app.repository

    # Execute commands.
    world.make_it_so('dinosaurs')
    world.make_it_so('trucks')

    # View current state of aggregate object.
    assert world.history[0] == 'dinosaurs'
    assert world.history[1] == 'trucks'

    # Note version of object at this stage.
    version = world.__version__

    # Execute another command.
    world.make_it_so('internet')

    # Store pending domain events.
    world.__save__()

    # Aggregate now exists in repository.
    assert world.id in app.repository

    # Show the notification log has four items.
    assert len(app.notification_log['current'].items) == 4

    # Replay stored events for aggregate.
    copy = app.repository[world.id]

    # View retrieved aggregate.
    assert isinstance(copy, World)
    assert copy.history[0] == 'dinosaurs'
    assert copy.history[1] == 'trucks'
    assert copy.history[2] == 'internet'

    # Verify retrieved state (cryptographically).
    assert copy.__head__ == world.__head__

    # Delete aggregate.
    world.__discard__()
    world.__save__()

    # Discarded aggregate not found.
    assert world.id not in app.repository
    try:
        # Repository raises key error.
        app.repository[world.id]
    except KeyError:
        pass
    else:
        raise Exception("Shouldn't get here")

    # Get historical state (at version from above).
    old = app.repository.get_entity(world.id, at=version)
    assert old.history[-1] == 'trucks' # internet not happened
    assert len(old.history) == 2

    # Optimistic concurrency control (no branches).
    old.make_it_so('future')
    try:
        old.__save__()
    except ConcurrencyError:
        pass
    else:
        raise Exception("Shouldn't get here")

    # Check domain event data integrity (happens also during replay).
    events = app.event_store.list_events(world.id)
    last_hash = ''
    for event in events:
        event.__check_hash__()
        assert event.__previous_hash__ == last_hash
        last_hash = event.__event_hash__

    # Verify stored sequence of events against known value.
    assert last_hash == world.__head__

    # Check records are encrypted (values not visible in database).
    record_manager = app.event_store.record_manager
    items = record_manager.get_items(world.id)
    for item in items:
        for what in [b'dinosaurs', b'trucks', b'internet']:
            assert what not in item.state
        assert world.id == item.originator_id

    # Project application event notifications.
    reader = NotificationLogReader(app.notification_log)
    notification_ids = [n['id'] for n in reader.read()]
    assert notification_ids == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # - create two more aggregates
    world = World.__create__()
    world.__save__()

    world = World.__create__()
    world.__save__()

    # - get the new event notifications from the reader
    notification_ids = [n['id'] for n in reader.read()]
    assert notification_ids == [6, 7]
```

The double leading and trailing underscore naming style, seen above,
is used consistently in the library's domain entity and event
base classes for attribute and method names, so that developers can
begin with a clean namespace. The intention is that the library
functionality is included in the application by aliasing these library
names with names that work within the project's ubiquitous language.

This style breaks PEP8, but it seems worthwhile in order to keep the
"normal" Python object namespace free for domain modelling. It is a style
used by other libraries (such as SQLAlchemy and Django) for similar reasons.

The exception is the ``id`` attribute of the domain entity base class,
which is assumed to be required by all domain entities (or aggregates) in
all domains.
